# Real-Time Local Volunteer Matching

## Overview

This project aims to create a platform for real-time local volunteer matching, where volunteers can sign up for various events, and tasks are dynamically matched based on skills, location, and availability. The platform will leverage gamification elements, real-time updates, and AI-powered task suggestions to keep volunteers engaged and motivated. Volunteers will earn achievements and rewards for completing tasks, and organizations can easily track their events.

## Key Features

- *Real-Time Volunteer Matching*: Volunteers are matched to tasks based on their skills, interests, and location.
- *Dynamic Achievement Generation*: Volunteers earn achievements for completing tasks, attending events, and reaching milestones.
- *Gamified Experience*: Volunteers collect points, badges, and rewards as they complete tasks and participate in events.
- *QR Code Scanning for Task Completion*: Each task will have a unique QR code that volunteers can scan when completing the task to unlock achievements.
- *Task Recommendations Based on Profile*: AI will suggest tasks to volunteers based on their previous volunteering history and preferences.
- *Real-Time Updates*: Volunteers will see new events, task completions, and achievements in real-time.

## Technology Stack

- *Backend*:
  - Bun.js (for backend services and API routing)
  - Fastify (for handling HTTP requests)
  - WebSockets (using Socket.io for real-time updates)
  - MongoDB (for persistent data storage)

- *Frontend*:
  - Next.js (for the frontend)
  - React (for interactive UI components)

- *External Libraries*:
  - qrcode (for generating QR codes)
  - socket.io-client (for connecting the frontend to the backend via WebSockets)
  - react-qr-reader (for QR code scanning on the frontend)

## Functionalities and Features

1. *Volunteer Registration & Authentication*
    - Volunteers can sign up using email, Google, or social media accounts.
    - Volunteer profiles include details like skills, availability, and past volunteering experience.

2. *Event Creation & Task Assignment*
    - Organizations can create volunteer events and tasks (e.g., park cleanup, food bank support).
    - Tasks are dynamically assigned to volunteers based on their skills, availability, and location.

3. *Real-Time Task Matching & Updates*
    - Volunteers are instantly matched to tasks and notified via WebSockets when new tasks become available or when they are assigned to a task.
    - Real-time notifications keep volunteers engaged and updated on task progress.

4. *Gamification and Achievements*
    - Volunteers earn achievements for completing tasks, attending events, and participating in leaderboards.
    - Tasks are tied to achievement templates, allowing dynamic generation of achievements.
    - Badges, points, and event-specific rewards are awarded for milestones.

5. *QR Code-Based Task Completion*
    - Each task has a unique QR code.
    - Volunteers scan the QR code after completing a task to confirm completion and unlock achievements.
    - Achievements are updated in the user profile in real-time.

6. *AI-Powered Task Suggestions*
    - The platform will suggest new tasks based on the volunteer's past activities and interests.
    - Volunteers can also select their preferred days to receive task recommendations, aligning with their availability.

## Time Estimates and Milestones

### *1. Project Setup (2-3 hours)*

- Set up Bun.js and Fastify for the backend.
- Set up Next.js for the frontend.
- Integrate MongoDB for persistent data storage.

### *2. Volunteer Registration & Authentication (2-3 hours)*

- Set up user registration and authentication using JWT.
- Integrate OAuth for Google/Facebook login (if necessary).

### *3. Event and Task Creation (3-4 hours)*

- Create event creation functionality for organizations.
- Implement task assignment logic based on volunteer profile data (skills, location, availability).
- Create a form for volunteers to sign up for tasks and events.

### *4. Real-Time Updates (3-4 hours)*

- Implement WebSocket communication (using Socket.io).
- Push real-time notifications for new tasks and event updates to volunteers.

### *5. Gamification (4-5 hours)*

- Implement achievement logic based on task completion, event attendance, and milestones.
- Create templates for dynamic achievement generation (e.g., Task Completion, Difficulty-Based Achievements, Event Participation).
- Implement badge and point rewards.

### *6. QR Code Task Completion (3-4 hours)*

- Generate unique QR codes for each task using the qrcode library.
- Implement QR code scanning on the frontend using react-qr-reader.
- Update user achievements upon successful task completion.

### *7. AI-Powered Task Suggestions (4-5 hours)*

- Implement an AI algorithm (or simple rule-based logic) to suggest tasks based on volunteer history and preferences.
- Allow volunteers to set availability and receive recommendations accordingly.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- *Email Notifications*:
  - Allow volunteers to opt into daily or weekly email notifications for new volunteer opportunities based on their preferences (e.g., availability, location, type of tasks).
  
- *Leaderboards*:
  - Add a competitive element by showing the top volunteers for each event/task, encouraging friendly competition and more engagement.

- *Mobile App*:
  - Though the focus is on a web platform, you could later extend the system into a mobile app for easy access to task registration and scanning QR codes in the field.

- *Volunteer Impact Tracking*:
  - Track the total impact each volunteer has made (e.g., total hours volunteered, total tasks completed, total people helped).
